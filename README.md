# Title: I Was Tired of Rewriting My Resume for Every Job in Zambiaâ€”So I Started Building a Solution

If youâ€™ve ever applied for a job in Zambia, you know the drill: find a promising opportunity, then spend hours editing your resume to fit the role. Whether itâ€™s a position with an NGO in Lusaka or a tech opening in Kitwe, the process is tedious and repetitive.

I decided to do something about it.

Career Connect Zambia (CCZ) is a prototype of a smarter job platform built for the Zambian market.

The vision is simple:
Create your profile once. Apply to multiple jobs effortlessly.

ðŸ”¹ One-click job applications
ðŸ”¹ Automatically generated, tailored PDF resumes
ðŸ”¹ Smart job alerts based on your skills

Although itâ€™s still in development, CCZ aims to make life easier for both job seekers and employers. Candidates save time and energy, while companies benefit from consistent, AI-enhanced profiles that make recruitment faster and more effective.

This project is built using Next.js, React, Firebase, and Genkit for AIâ€”with heavy use of Vibe Coding, an AI-assisted development approach where natural language prompts are used to generate functional code via large language models. Itâ€™s been a game-changer in speeding up development and testing ideas.

The prototype is open source, and Iâ€™m looking for collaborators!
If you're a developer who's experienced this problem or just wants to help shape better job tech for Zambia, Iâ€™d love for you to contribute.

Letâ€™s eliminate resume fatigueâ€”and build a platform that truly connects talent with opportunity.
