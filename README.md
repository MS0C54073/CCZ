# Title: I Was Tired of Rewriting My Resume for Every Job in Zambiaâ€”So I Started Building a Solution
#
If youâ€™ve ever applied for a job in Zambia, you know the drill: find a promising opportunity, then spend hours editing your resume to fit the role. Whether itâ€™s a position with an NGO in Lusaka or a tech opening in Kitwe, the process is tedious and repetitive.

I decided to do something about it.

Career Connect Zambia (CCZ) is a prototype of a smarter job platform built for the Zambian market.

The vision is simple:
Create your profile once. Apply to multiple jobs effortlessly.

## Functionalities:

*   **One-click job applications:** Apply to jobs with a single click using your saved profile.
*   **Automatically generated, tailored PDF resumes:** Generate customized resumes for specific job applications based on your profile information.
*   **Smart job alerts based on your skills:** Receive notifications about relevant job openings that match your skills and preferences.
*   **Create and manage your profile:** Build a comprehensive profile including your skills, experience, education, and other relevant information.
*   **Search and browse job listings:** Easily find job opportunities based on keywords, location, industry, and other filters.
*   **Post job openings (for employers):** Employers can create and manage their job listings on the platform.

This project is built using Next.js, React, Firebase, and Genkit for AIâ€”with heavy use of Vibe Coding, an AI-assisted development approach where natural language prompts are used to generate functional code via large language models. Itâ€™s been a game-changer in speeding up development and testing ideas.

The prototype is open source, and Iâ€™m looking for collaborators!
If you're a developer who's experienced this problem or just wants to help shape better job tech for Zambia, Iâ€™d love for you to contribute.
