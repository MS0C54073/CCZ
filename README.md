🇿🇲 CCZ - Career Connect Zambia
📌 Overview
CCZ (Career Connect Zambia) is a Zambian-tailored job portal web application built to empower job seekers and employers with modern tools to find opportunities and talent across all industries — from ICT to mining, healthcare, NGOs, government jobs, and more.

This platform is mobile-first, smart-search enabled, and resume-driven — designed to solve one frustrating problem many Zambians (including myself) face:

“Why do I have to recreate my resume every time I apply for a job?”

With CCZ, you create your professional profile once and use it to:

Automatically generate downloadable PDF resumes

Apply to multiple jobs without retyping the same information

Filter jobs by location, field, or salary

Receive smart alerts for job openings that match your profile

🎯 Why I Built This
As a Zambian professional, I was tired of constantly re-typing and redesigning my resume for every single job application. Whether it was for an NGO role in Lusaka, an internship in Kitwe, or a government post in Ndola — it always meant the same: hours spent copying, pasting, formatting, editing dates, fixing typos...

So I decided: no more.

CCZ is built to streamline that entire process:

One clean, professional profile

Automatic resume generation

One-click job applications

Smart, local job discovery

This isn't just for me — it’s for everyone in Zambia who’s ever struggled with resume fatigue or inaccessible job systems.

### 🚧 **Project Status: Demo Prototype** 🚧

**Please Note:** This application is currently a demonstration prototype. Many features are still under active development. The primary goal is to showcase the core functionalities and user interface.

**What's working right now:**
*   **User Authentication:** Sign up and log in with Email/Password, Google, and LinkedIn.
*   **Job Discovery:** Browse and search for jobs with filters for keywords, location (province/city), and salary. Jobs are sorted by the most recent posting date and listings older than 30 days are automatically removed.
*   **Job Posting:** Employers can fill out a form to post a new job, including company logo uploads. The form uses AI to suggest relevant skills based on the job description.
*   **Profile Management:** Job seekers can create and edit a detailed professional profile, including personal information, work experience, education, skills, certifications, and driver's license details. An AI-powered summary can be generated based on the profile content.
*   **Dashboards:**
    *   **Job Seeker:** View application history and track profile completion percentage with dynamic suggestions for improvement.
    *   **Recruiter:** View and manage posted jobs, including an option to delete listings.
